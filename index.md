## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student @ UIUC ECE

## Research Interests

I have a broad interest in **systems** and **computer architecture**. I am currently exploring systems for machine learning, with a particular focus on prefill/decode disaggregation in LLM inference. 

## Projects

- Rearchitecting Storage Stacks for Host Interconnect Bottlenecks
  - Developed a contention-detection mechanism to detect host-interconnect bottlenecks, and rearchitected the Linux block layer to dynamically regulate in-flight I/O requests based on observed contention levels, achieving improved overall throughput and latency.
- Fast and Safe I/O Memory Protection in Virtual Environments
  - Analyzing I/O memory-protection overheads in virtualized environments, and redesigning virtualization stacks to provide high performance without compromising safety guarantees.
